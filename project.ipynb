    "In today's world, fake news has become a significant issue, especially in the context of elections and politics. The divisiveness caused by fake news can have far-reaching consequences on public opinion and societal harmony. Our project aims to analyze fake news and determine if the words and language structure of an article can indicate its reliability. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, we hope to uncover patterns that distinguish fake news from true news.\n"
