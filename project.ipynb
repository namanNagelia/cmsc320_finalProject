    "# Introduction\n",
    "# \n",
    "In today's fast-paced information age, distinguishing between true and false statements has become more challenging than ever. With the rise of social media and digital news platforms, information spreads at an unprecedented rate, making it difficult to verify credibility. Misinformation can shape public opinion, influence elections, and even impact policy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify statements based on their truthfulness. Using machine learning models, we aim to identify patterns in language, source credibility, and contextual indicators that differentiate true statements from false, half-true, mostly-true, and barely-true claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset consists of fact-checked statements made by public figures, politicians, and media sources, each labeled with a truthfulness category. By training our model on these labeled statements, we aim to develop an automated classification system that can predict the accuracy of new statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we will explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models (logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)\n",
    "\n",
    "While our model will not be perfect, it will serve as a foundation for improving automated fact-checkingâ€”a crucial tool in combating misinformation in the digital world.\n"

    "To classify each statement with relevant subjects, we employ a two-step approach that combines keyword-based inference and semantic similarity matching using Sentence-BERT (SBERT).\n",

    "To infer the subject of a statement, we use a predefined keyword-to-subject mapping. This mapping consists of key topics (e.g., economy, health-care, foreign-policy) and associated keywords commonly found in statements related to those topics.\n",

    "By scanning each statement for the presence of these keywords, we can automatically infer up to three relevant subjects even if the statement does not explicitly mention the category.\n",

    "A statement containing \"inflation\" or \"GDP\" is classified under \"economy\".\n",

    "A statement mentioning \"medicare\" or \"hospital\" is linked to \"health-care\".\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Semantic Similarity-Based Subject Matching using SBERT\n",
    "Since statements may cover complex or nuanced topics beyond simple keyword matching, we use SBERT embeddings and cosine similarity to match each statement to the most relevant subjects from our predefined topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps involved:\n",
    "Convert all statements and subjects into SBERT embeddings â€“ This captures the semantic meaning of both statements and policy topics. Bert considers context in the meaning of the word which is why we use it.\n",

    "Compute cosine similarity between statement embeddings and subject embeddings â€“ This measures how close a statement is to each policy category.\n",
