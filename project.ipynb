    "# Introduction\n",
    "# \n",
    "In today's fast-paced information age, distinguishing between true and false statements has become more challenging than ever. With the rise of social media and digital news platforms, information spreads at an unprecedented rate, making it difficult to verify credibility. Misinformation can shape public opinion, influence elections, and even impact policy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify statements based on their truthfulness. Using machine learning models, we aim to identify patterns in language, source credibility, and contextual indicators that differentiate true statements from false, half-true, mostly-true, and barely-true claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset consists of fact-checked statements made by public figures, politicians, and media sources, each labeled with a truthfulness category. By training our model on these labeled statements, we aim to develop an automated classification system that can predict the accuracy of new statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we will explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models (logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)\n",
    "\n",
    "While our model will not be perfect, it will serve as a foundation for improving automated fact-checking—a crucial tool in combating misinformation in the digital world.\n"

    "#\n",
    "This allows us to observe how frequently each rating appears, identify any imbalances in the dataset, and gain insights into the overall reliability trends. Understanding this distribution is crucial for ensuring that our model is trained on a well-represented set of labels and can make meaningful predictions."

    "Some observations from the plot: \n",
    "- The \"pants-fire\" category, which represents the most extreme form of falsehood and lying, has fewer instances compared to regular \"false\" statements.\n",
    "- The \"false\" category has the highest count, indicating that a significant portion of the statements in the dataset are classified as outright false.\n",
    "- The counts for \"barely-true,\" \"half-true,\" and \"mostly-true\" are fairly similar, suggesting a somewhat balanced representation of statements with varying degrees of truthfulness.\n",
    "- Similarly, the \"true\" category has the lowest count among the truth-based labels, indicating that fewer statements in the dataset are considered entirely true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the dataset has a fairly even distribution of reliability counts, with most categories containing between 4,000 to 5,000 statements. The outliers are the \"pants-fire\" and \"false\" categories. Despite these outliers, the diversity in the data should help us create a well-trained and robust model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, false statements (pants-fire, false, barely-true) appear more frequently than true statements (half-true, mostly-true, true). Specifically, about 18,600 statements are false, compared to 12,767 true statements. This means approximately 60% of the dataset consists of false statements, which could impact the model's performance. The model may have a tendency to predict \"false\" more frequently than \"true.\" This is something we'll consider as we build the model, and we may make adjustments if necessary.\n",

    "- Barely_true_counts has the highest correlation with other categories, with 0.924 for false_counts, 0.884 for half_true_counts, and 0.837 for mostly_true_counts. This suggests that when a speaker has a history of making statements that are \"barely true,\" these are strongly associated with past counts in varying truthfullness levels which are not fully true or fully false. \n",
    "\n",
    "- False_counts has strong correlations with barely_true_counts (0.924) and pants_fire_counts (0.691), which indicates that speakers who frequently make fully false statements also tend to make statements that have varying degrees of falsehood.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Half_true_counts and mostly_true_counts are very strongly correlated with each other (0.986), suggesting that when a speaker tends to tell \"half-true\" statements, they also tend to make \"mostly-true\" statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, looking at the correlation with reliability_numeric (which represents the current statement's reliability)\n",
    "- barely_true_counts: There is a very weak correlation (0.003) with reliability_numeric. This indicates that a higher count of barely true statements in the past doesn't seem to significantly affect the reliability of the current statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- false_counts: The correlation is -0.077, which is very weak and indicates a very slight negative relationship. In other words, having more past false statements does not strongly correlate with the current statement being reliable or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- half_true_counts: The correlation is 0.11, suggesting a slight positive but weak relationship with the current statement's reliability.  This means that a speaker who has often made \"half true\" statements in the past might slightly be more likely to produce a reliable statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- mostly_true_counts: The correlation is 0.134, indicating a very weak positive correlation. This suggests that a speaker who has often made \"mostly true\" statements in the past might slightly be more likely to produce a reliable statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- pants_fire_counts: The correlation is -0.257, indicating a moderate negative correlation. This suggests that speakers who have made more \"pants fire\" statements in the past are more likely to have a less reliable current statement."
